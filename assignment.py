Assignment-1 

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language? 

      We call high-level programming language because it is in readable form then compiler convert into 0&1 format to read the instruction. 

It is called general purpose because in all the fields we can use the python there is no specific domain where we cannot use it. 

 

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language? 

        Due to type casting. 

 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language? 

Pros -object oriented languages, dynamically typed language 

Cons -  

  

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python? 

Machine learning, Data Science, Deep Learning 

  

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them? 

Variable are the names given to the specific memory location 

  

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python? 

By using the function called input () or directly can be taken from keyboard 

Ex: name= input () or name = input (“Enter the name of user:”) 

  

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function? 

Text type  

Q8. What is type casting? 

The casting is nothing but converting one type of data type to others 

 

 

 

  

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input () function? If yes, how? If no, why? 

We can take mutiple input 

x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split() 

print("the value of x: ", x) 

print(" the value of y: ", y) 

print() 

 

Q10. What are keywords? 

Instruction are the keywords example  

If ,elif, else, for, print 

  

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason. 

NO 

  

Q12. What is indentation? What is the use of indentaion in Python? 

To check the conditions to make the decision 

  

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python? 

Print() 

  

Q14. What are operators in Python? 

+  addition ,- sub ,* mul,/ float div,//  int div,**  power,% remainder 

  

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators? 

/ float division 

// int division 

  

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output. 

``` 

iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron 

``` 

x = 'ineuron' 

y=x*4 

print((y)) 

 

  

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even. 

Num = int(input() ) 

x=Num % 2 

if x==1: 

    print("entered number is odd") 

else: 

    print("entered number is even") 

	 

  

Q18. What are boolean operator? 

Boolean operator to just the condition whether its true or false 

  

Q19. What will the output of the following? 

``` 

1 or 0        True 

  

0 and 0     False 

  

True and False and True    False 

  

1 or 0 or 0    True 

``` 

  

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python? 

If  and else are the condition statement in python 

  

 

 

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords? 

For nested loops if we have more than 2 conditions 

 

 

 

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote". 
 

name = input() 

age = int(input()) 

print("user name=",name) 

print("user age=",age) 

if age >= 18: 

    print("I can vote") 

else: 

        print("I can't vote") 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list. 

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50] 

Sol: 

number=[12,75,150,180,145,525,50] 

sum=0 

for i in number: 

    rem = i % 2 ; 

    if (rem == 0): 

        sum = sum + i; 

    else: 

        sum = sum; 

print("the sum of given list is=", sum) 

 

 

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output. 

x=input() 

y=input() 

z=input() 

if x>y: 

    great = x; 

else: 

    great = y; 

if great>z: 

    great = great; 

else: 

    great =z; 

print ("the greater among 3 value is=", great) 

 

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions 

  

- The number must be divisible by five 

  

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number 

  

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop 

``` 

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50] 

 

Didn’t understand sorry
